  <Accordion title="How do I switch my Same project between public and private?">
    You can change project visibility in the **Workbench**. Open the Workbench (top-right arrows) and click the lock icon to toggle between **Public** (viewable/forkable by anyone) and **Private** (accessible only to you).

<Accordion title="What is the refund policy if Same wastes tokens?">
  If you believe Same malfunctioned and caused excessive token usage unrelated
  to your prompts (e.g., due to a bug causing loops or repeated failures),
  please contact support at [support@same.dev](mailto:support@same.dev). Include
  your Project URL, a description of the issue, and any relevant Request IDs. We
  review cases individually and may issue credits or refunds if a platform
  malfunction is confirmed.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The workbench/files aren't there or are blank. What should I do?">
    If the workbench or file tree appears blank or doesn't load, try refreshing the page. If the issue persists, you may need to [revert to the last known good version](/essentials/version-control#accessing-version-history). We are actively working on improving the client/server connection stability to prevent this from happening.
