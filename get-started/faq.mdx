  <Accordion title="How do I make my project public or private?">
    1.  Open the **Workbench** (click the arrows icon <Icon name="arrow-up-right-and-arrow-down-left-from-center" /> in the top-right).
    2.  Click the **Lock icon** (<Icon icon="lock" /> / <Icon icon="unlock" />) in the Workbench header.
    3.  This toggles between **Public** (anyone can view/fork) and **Private** (only you can access).

<Accordion title="What if Same uses too many tokens due to an error?">
  If you suspect a bug caused excessive token usage (e.g., loops, repeated
  failures unrelated to your prompts), contact support at
  [support@same.dev](mailto:support@same.dev). Include: * Your Project URL. * A
  description of the issue. * Relevant Request IDs (if possible, found in error
  messages). We review these cases individually. If a platform malfunction is
  confirmed, we may issue credits or refunds. See [Agent
  Tokens](/usage/agent-tokens) for more on usage.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The workbench or file tree is blank. What do I do?">
    1.  **Refresh the page.** This often resolves temporary loading issues.
    2.  If the problem persists, try **reverting to the last known good version** using the [Version Control](/essentials/version-control#restoring-and-reverting-checkpoints) features.
    We are working on improving connection stability to prevent this.
