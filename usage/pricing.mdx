## How Usage is Calculated

Usage is based on **agent tokens**. Every interaction with Same, including processing prompts, analyzing context (like URLs or images), and generating code, consumes tokens.

- **Base Tokens**: Your $10 monthly subscription includes 2 million agent tokens.
- **Overage**: If you exceed 2 million tokens in a month, you'll be charged $5 for each additional million tokens used.

You can monitor your usage in your account settings. Learn more about [Agent Tokens](/usage/agent-tokens).
