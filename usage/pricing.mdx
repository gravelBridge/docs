## What are Agent Tokens?

Same uses "agent tokens" to measure the computational resources used during interactions. Think of tokens as pieces of words or code. For more details on how tokens work, see the [Agent Tokens](/usage/agent-tokens) page.

## How Usage is Calculated

Usage is based on **agent tokens**. Every interaction with Same, including processing prompts, analyzing context (like URLs or images), and generating code, consumes tokens.

- **Free Plan Tokens**: Includes 500,000 agent tokens per month. Upgrade to Pro for more tokens.
- **Pro Plan Base Tokens**: Your $10 monthly subscription includes 2 million agent tokens.
- **Pro Plan Overage**: If you exceed 2 million tokens in a month on the Pro plan, you'll be charged $5 for each additional million tokens used.

You can monitor your usage in your account settings. Learn more about [Agent Tokens](/usage/agent-tokens).

### Setting Spending Limits (Pro Plan)

Pro plan users can set a monthly spending limit in their account settings to control costs beyond the included 2 million tokens. Once the limit is reached, further token usage will be restricted until the next billing cycle or until the limit is increased.
