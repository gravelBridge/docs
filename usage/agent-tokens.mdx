## What are Agent Tokens?

Same uses "agent tokens" as the primary unit to measure the resources used when you interact with Same. Think of tokens as small pieces of text or code that Same processes. Every interaction, from generating code to understanding your prompts and context, consumes a certain number of agent tokens.

## How Usage is Measured

Token usage depends on several factors:

- **Prompt Length**: Longer and more complex prompts require more tokens to process.
- **Context Size**: Providing files, screenshots, or previous conversation history as context increases token usage. The larger the context, the more tokens are needed.
- **Generated Output**: The length and complexity of the code or text generated by Same contribute to token consumption.
- **Tool Usage**: When Same uses tools like file editing, terminal commands, or web browsing, additional tokens are consumed for the tool's operation and processing its results.

## Monitoring Your Usage

You can monitor your token usage within Same. Your remaining token balance and usage history are available in your account settings.
