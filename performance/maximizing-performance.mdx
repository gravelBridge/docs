Follow these strategies to get the best results and manage costs effectively when using Same.

## 1. Start New Chats Frequently

Treat each chat as a single task or feature.

**Benefits:**

- **Cost Control:** Prevents context windows from becoming too large, reducing token usage.
- **Accuracy:** Keeps Same focused on the current task without confusion from old context.
- **Debugging:** Makes it easier to isolate issues within a shorter history.

**When to start a new chat:**

- After completing a feature.
- When switching to a significantly different task.
- If the chat history becomes very long or Same seems confused.

<Tip>
  Use the "New Chat" button (<Icon icon="plus" /> icon, top-right in chat panel)
  to start fresh.
</Tip>

## 2. Provide Specific Context

Help Same understand exactly what you need.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use '@ Add context'" icon="at">
    Click the `@ Add context` button in the chat input to: - Select specific
    project files for Same to read or modify. - Include summaries of relevant
    previous chats.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Provide Links" icon="link">
    Share URLs to documentation, examples, or inspiration sites. Same can browse
    these for information.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Frame

  className="mt-4"
>
  <img

    alt="Screenshot showing the '@ Add context' button in the chat input area."
  />
</Frame>

Targeted context is more efficient than asking Same to search broadly. See [Building with Same](/essentials/building#providing-context).

## 3. Use Version Control Effectively

If Same makes a mistake:

1.  **Find the last good state:** Look through the message history or use the [Version History](/essentials/version-control#accessing-version-history) panel (clock icon <Icon icon="clock" />) to find the checkpoint _before_ the error.
2.  **Restore checkpoint:** Click "Restore checkpoint" next to the message/action to preview that state in the workbench.
3.  **Revert (if needed):** If the preview is correct, click "Revert to checkpoint". This resets the project to that checkpoint **(irreversible)**.

<Frame caption="Use 'Restore checkpoint' and 'Revert to checkpoint' to manage project history.">
  <img
    src="/images/restore-checkpoint.png"
    alt="Screenshot showing the 'Restore checkpoint' button next to a message."
  />
</Frame>

Reverting to a known good state is often faster than trying to fix multiple errors. See the [Version Control](/essentials/version-control) guide.
