To get the most out of Same and ensure efficient, accurate development, follow these key strategies:

## 1. Start New Chats Frequently

Think of each chat session as a focused task or feature. Starting new chats regularly offers several benefits:

- **Cost Management:** Each chat has its own context window. Shorter, focused chats prevent the context from growing excessively large, which directly reduces token consumption and associated costs.
- **Improved Accuracy:** A clean slate prevents confusion from unrelated previous instructions or context, helping Same stay focused on the current task.
- **Easier Debugging:** If something goes wrong, isolating the issue within a shorter chat history is much simpler.

**When to start a new chat:**

- After successfully completing a feature.
- When starting a new, distinct task (e.g., fixing a bug vs. adding a new component).
- If a chat becomes too long or Same seems confused.

<Tip>
  Use the "New Chat" button (top-right '+' icon in the chat panel) to quickly
  start fresh.

## 2. Provide Rich Context

Same relies heavily on the context you provide. The better the context, the better the results.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Include Relevant Files" icon="file-code">
    Use the `@ Add context` button in the chat input to select specific files
    Same needs to understand or modify. This is much more efficient than relying
    on Same to search for them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reference Past Conversations" icon="comments">
    If a previous chat contains relevant decisions or code, use the `@ Add
    context` button to include a summary of that chat. This gives Same valuable
    background without bloating the current context window.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Learn more about providing context effectively in the [Building with Same](/essentials/building#providing-context) guide.

## 3. Leverage Version Control & Reverting

Mistakes happen! Same automatically creates checkpoints throughout the development process. If Same makes an incorrect change or breaks something:

1.  **Identify the last working state:** Use the message history or the [Version History](/essentials/version-control#accessing-version-history) panel (clock icon) to find the checkpoint before the issue occurred.
2.  **Restore the checkpoint:** Click "Restore checkpoint" next to the relevant message or action block to preview that state.
3.  **Revert (if necessary):** If the preview looks correct, click "Revert to checkpoint". This will permanently reset the project to that state and clear subsequent messages in the chat.

</Frame>

Don't be afraid to revert. It's often faster to go back to a known good state and give Same clearer instructions than to try and fix a series of compounding errors. Read the full guide on [Version Control](/essentials/version-control).

By combining frequent new chats, targeted context, and effective use of reverting, you can maximize Same's performance, manage costs, and build faster.
