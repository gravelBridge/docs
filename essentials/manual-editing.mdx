While Same excels at generating and modifying code based on your prompts, sometimes you need to make precise manual adjustments or manage your project files directly. Same provides a powerful integrated workbench with a code editor, terminal, and file management tools.

## The Code Editor

The built-in code editor allows you to directly modify the files in your project.

Key features:

- **File Tree:** Navigate your project's directory structure on the left panel. Right-click (or long-press on mobile) on files or folders to access options like creating new files/folders, renaming, or deleting.
- **Saving:** Changes are automatically saved after a period of inactivity following edits. You can also manually save using `Cmd/Ctrl + S`. Unsaved changes are indicated in the top right of a file through the presence of a `Save` button.
- **Read-Only Mode:** If you are viewing a project you don't own, the editor will be in read-only mode. You'll need to fork the project to make edits.

### Creating Files and Folders

As the project owner, you can create new files and folders directly within the editor's file tree:

1.  **Right-click** (or long-press) on the desired parent folder (or empty space for root).
2.  Select **"New File"** or **"New Folder"**.
3.  Enter the name in the dialog that appears and confirm.

</Frame>

### Renaming and Deleting

Owners can also rename or delete files and folders via the right-click context menu in the file tree. Deleting a folder will remove all its contents.

## The Terminal

Access a fully functional terminal environment within the workbench.

</Frame>

Key features:

- **Run Commands:** Execute standard shell commands (`bun install`, `ls`, `git`, etc.).
- **Working Directory:** The terminal starts in the project's root directory (`/home/project`). Use standard `cd` commands to navigate.
- **Multiple Terminals:** Open multiple terminal tabs if needed using the '+' icon in the terminal tab bar.
- **Output:** Command output is displayed directly in the terminal panel.

<Info>
  The terminal environment is containerized. Changes made directly via the
  terminal might not always be perfectly reflected in Same's internal state
  unless they modify tracked files. For file modifications, using the editor or
  agent prompts is generally recommended.

## File and Folder Uploads

Project owners can upload files and folders directly into the project:

1.  **Drag and Drop:** Drag files or folders from your computer directly onto the file tree panel in the editor. Dropping onto a specific folder will upload into that folder; dropping onto empty space uploads to the root directory.
2.  **Upload Buttons:** Use the dedicated "Upload File" and "Upload Folder" buttons located at the bottom of the file tree panel. These upload to an `uploads` folder at the root directory.
