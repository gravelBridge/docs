While Same builds based on your prompts, you can also directly interact with the project using the integrated workbench.

## Code Editor

Modify project files directly in the editor.

**Key Features:**

- **File Tree:** Browse directories on the left. Right-click (or long-press on mobile) for options.
- **Saving:** Changes save automatically after inactivity, or manually with `Cmd/Ctrl + S`. An unsaved file shows a `Save` button in the header.
- **Read-Only Mode:** If viewing a project you don't own, you must fork it to enable editing.

### Creating Files and Folders

(Requires project ownership)

1.  **Right-click** (or long-press) in the file tree on a folder or empty space (for root).
2.  Select **"New File"** or **"New Folder"**.
3.  Enter a name and confirm.

### Renaming and Deleting

(Requires project ownership)

Use the right-click context menu in the file tree to rename or delete items. Deleting a folder removes all its contents.

## Terminal

Access a shell environment within the workbench.

## File and Folder Uploads

(Requires project ownership)

1.  **Drag and Drop:** Drag files/folders onto the file tree panel. Drop on a folder to upload there, or empty space for the root.
2.  **Upload Buttons:** Use the Upload File and Upload Folder buttons at the bottom of the file tree. These upload to an `uploads/` folder in the root.
