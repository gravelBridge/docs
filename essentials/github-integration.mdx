Same allows you to manage your project's code using Git and GitHub, providing flexibility for version control, collaboration, and deployment workflows. You can interact with GitHub in two main ways: by instructing Same or by using the integrated terminal directly.

## Using Same Agent for Git Actions

You can ask Same to perform basic Git operations like connecting to a remote repository, committing changes, and pushing.

```md
Connect this project to a GitHub repository named 'my-same-project'.
Then commit all current changes with the message 'Initial commit' and push to main.
```

Please be ready to enter your GitHub username and Personal Access Token (for password) in the terminal when prompted. See [GitHub's documentation on managing personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) for more information.

## Using the Integrated Terminal

For more control or complex Git operations, you can use the standard Git command-line interface directly within Same's integrated terminal.

1.  **Open the Workbench:** Click the arrows icon in the top-right corner.
2.  **Navigate to the Terminal Tab:** Select the terminal view.
3.  **Change Directory:** **Crucially**, you must first navigate into your project's directory. The terminal starts in `/home/project`, but your code resides in a subdirectory (usually matching your project's name). Use the `ls` command to see the directory name and then `cd [your-project-directory-name]` to enter it.
4.  **Run Git Commands:** Once inside your project directory, you can run standard Git commands:
    - `git init`
    - `git remote add origin <your-repo-url>`
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
    - `git push origin main`
    - `git pull`, `git status`, `git log`, etc.

<Info>
  On every page refresh, the terminal resets. Currently, you need to
  reinitialize git with `git init` each time; we are making this much better
  soon!

<Warning>
  Always ensure you are in the correct project directory (`cd
  [your-project-directory-name]`) before running Git commands like `git add`,
  `git commit`, or `git push`. Running them in the wrong directory might lead to
  unexpected behavior.
</Warning>

## Downloading Your Code

If you prefer to manage your code locally or use a different version control system, you can easily download your entire project as a ZIP file.

1.  **Open the Workbench:** Click the arrows icon in the top-right corner.
2.  **Click the Download Icon:** Locate and click the download icon (downward arrow) in the Workbench header.

This will package your current project files into a ZIP archive and initiate the download.
