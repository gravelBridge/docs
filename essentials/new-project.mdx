There are two ways to start a new project with Same:

## 1. Clone from URL or Image

If you want to replicate or iterate on an existing UI:

1.  **Paste a URL** into the input field. Same will visit the website and generate a clone.
2.  Or, **upload an image** (screenshot or mockup). Same will analyze the image and build the UI.

  <img
    className="mt-4"
    src="/images/start-from-url.png"
    alt="Input field showing a URL being pasted"
  />
</Frame>

## 2. Describe Your Project

If you're starting from scratch or a concept:

1.  **Type a description** of the UI you want to build into the input field.
2.  Be as specific or as vague as you want, you can iterate after the initial version is complete.

  <img
    src="/images/start-from-idea.png"
    alt="Input field where a user types a description"
  />
</Frame>

## Project Visibility

By default, new projects are **public**, meaning anyone with the link can view and fork them. You can make your project private.

**To change visibility:**

1.  Open the **Workbench** by clicking the arrows icon in the top-right.
2.  Click the **Lock icon** in the Workbench header.
3.  Toggle between **Public** and **Private**.

<Note>Only you can access your private projects.</Note>
