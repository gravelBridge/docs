## Starting your Project

There are two main ways to kick off your project:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Clone from URL" icon="link">
    Provide Same with a URL, and it will visit the website, analyze its UI, and generate a pixel-perfect clone as the starting point for your project. This is ideal if you want to replicate or iterate on an existing design.

    <Frame>
      <img className="mt-4" src="/images/start-from-idea.png" alt="Input field where a user types a description" />
    </Frame>

  </Card>
  <Card title="Describe Your Project" icon="pen-nib">
    If you don't have a specific URL to clone, simply describe the UI you want to build. Same will generate the initial structure and components based on your requirements. This is perfect for starting from scratch or building based on a concept.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/start-from-idea.png" alt="Input field where a user types a description" />
    </Frame>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Choose the method that best suits your needs and start building instantly!

## Changing Project Visibility

You can easily switch your project between public and private access:

1.  **Open the Workbench:** Click the arrows icon in the top-right corner of the interface.
2.  **Find the Lock Icon:** Locate the lock icon within the Workbench interface.
3.  **Toggle Visibility:** Click the lock icon to switch between:
    - **Public:** Anyone with the link can view and fork your project.
    - **Private:** Only you can access the project.

<Frame caption="Toggle project visibility using the lock icon in the Workbench.">
  <img
    src="/images/project-visibility.png"
    alt="Screenshot showing the lock icon in the Workbench to toggle project visibility."
  />
</Frame>
