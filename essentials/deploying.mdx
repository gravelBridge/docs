Deploy your project to the web with Same's Netlify integration.

## Triggering Deployment

Same often deploys automatically when a task seems complete. You can also trigger it manually:

1.  **Ask Same:**
    ```md
    Deploy this application
    ```
    <Frame caption="Prompt Same to deploy your application.">
      <img
        src="/images/deploy-this.png"
        alt="Screenshot showing the prompt 'Deploy this application' in the chat input."
      />
    </Frame>
2.  **Use the Workbench:**
    - Open the **Workbench**.
    - Click the **Deploy** status button in the top-right.
    - Click the **Deploy** button in the popover.

## Deployment URLs

After deployment, you'll get:

1.  **Preview URL:** A unique URL for that specific deployment (e.g., `unique-id--your-project.netlify.app`). Good for testing.
2.  **Main URL:** The primary project URL (e.g., `your-project-name.same-app.com`). Always points to the latest _main_ deployment.

## Managing Deployments

Click the deployment status button (e.g., "Deployed") in the Workbench header to manage your deployment.

<Frame caption="Click the deployment status in the Workbench to manage your deployment.">
  <img
    src="/images/deploy.png"
    alt="Screenshot showing the deployment management options like 'Claim Deployment' and 'Take Down'."
  />
</Frame>

- **Claim Deployment:** Transfer the Netlify site to your own Netlify account. You'll be redirected to Netlify to log in or sign up.
- **Take Down:** Unpublish the website.

<Info>
  For advanced Netlify settings (like custom domains added *after* claiming),
  manage the site directly on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).
