title: Building with Same
description: "Learn how to effectively collaborate with Same to build and iterate on your projects."

Building with Same is an iterative process. You provide instructions, Same generates code and performs actions, and you review the results, providing further guidance as needed. Here's how to get the most out of the building process:

## Adding New Features

Clearly describe the feature you want to add. Be specific about the functionality and any visual requirements.

```md
Add a dark mode toggle button to the top right corner of the header.
It should switch between light and dark themes for the entire application.
```

Same will analyze your request and the current project state to implement the feature.

## Providing Context

Context is crucial for Same to understand your requirements accurately. You can provide context in several ways:

- **Links:** Share URLs to documentation, examples, or inspiration sites. Same can browse the web to gather information.
  ```md
  Use the styling from this example: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/button
  ```
- **Files:** Attach relevant code snippets, design mockups (images), or configuration files directly in the chat. Use the `@ Add context` button in the chat input to select files from your project or upload new ones.
- **Previous Messages:** Same remembers the conversation history within the current chat session and has a summary of the past chat conversation (you can include more!). Refer back to previous steps or decisions.

<Tip>
  The more relevant context you provide, the better Same can understand your
  intent and generate the desired output. Use the `@ Add context` button in the
  chat input to easily add files or previous chat summaries as context.

## Breaking Down Large Changes

For complex features or significant refactoring, break down the request into smaller, manageable steps. This makes the process easier to follow and allows for course correction along the way.

Instead of: "Rebuild the entire dashboard with a new design and add analytics."

Try:

1.  "Update the color scheme to match the new design guide (link)."
2.  "Refactor the main dashboard component to use the new `Card` component."
3.  "Add a chart component to display user signups."
4.  "Integrate a basic analytics tracking event for button clicks."

This step-by-step approach helps Same focus on one task at a time, leading to more accurate results and easier debugging if issues arise.

## Reviewing and Iterating

Same will show you the changes it makes (diffs) and update the live preview.

- **Review Diffs:** Check the code changes in the tool invocation blocks to understand what Same modified.
- **Check the Preview:** Use the live preview panel to see the visual results of the changes.
- **Provide Feedback:** If the result isn't quite right, tell Same what needs to be adjusted. Be specific about the changes you want.
  ```md
  The button looks good, but can you make it slightly smaller and change the
  text color to white in dark mode?
  ```

Building complex UIs often involves several rounds of iteration. Don't hesitate to ask for adjustments until you're satisfied with the result.

## Editing Messages

Made a typo or want to refine your instructions? You can edit your previous messages.

1.  **Hover over the message** you want to edit.
2.  Click the **pencil icon** that appears.
3.  Make your changes in the text area.
4.  **Submit** the edited message.

Same will then process your updated instructions, reverting the project state (if you choose so) and clearing subsequent messages.
