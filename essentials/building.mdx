description: "How to give instructions, provide context, and iterate on your project."

Building with Same involves instructing the agent, reviewing its work, and providing feedback.

## Giving Instructions

Clearly describe what you want Same to do. Be specific about features, functionality, and appearance.

```md
Add a dark mode toggle button to the top right corner of the header.
```

Same analyzes your request and the current project state to implement the changes.

## Providing Context

Good context helps Same understand your needs.

- **Links:** Provide URLs to documentation, examples, or inspiration.
  ```md
  Use the styling from this example: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/button
  ```
- **Files & Summaries:** Use the `@ Add context` button in the chat input.
  - Select specific project files Same needs to read or modify.
  - Include summaries of previous relevant chats.
- **Conversation History:** Refer to previous messages or decisions within the current chat.

<Tip>
  Using `@ Add context` is more efficient than asking Same to search for
  information.

## Breaking Down Large Tasks

For complex changes, give Same smaller, sequential instructions.

Instead of: "Rebuild the entire dashboard with a new design and add analytics."

Try:

1.  "Update the color scheme using these hex codes: #..."
2.  "Refactor the dashboard Card component to use Tailwind CSS."
3.  "Add a chart component here to display user signups."
4.  "Add analytics tracking for button clicks."

This helps Same focus and makes it easier to review changes.

## Reviewing and Iterating

Same shows code changes (diffs) and updates the live preview.

1.  **Review Diffs:** Check the tool invocation blocks to see what code changed.
2.  **Check Preview:** Verify the visual changes in the live preview panel.
3.  **Give Feedback:** If needed, tell Same what to adjust. Be specific.
    ```md
    Make the button smaller and change the text color to white in dark mode.
    ```

## Editing Your Messages

If you need to change a previous instruction:

1.  Hover over your message.
2.  Click the **pencil icon**.
3.  Edit the text.
4.  Submit the changes.

Same will process the updated instruction. You may be asked if you want to revert the project state to that point, which would clear subsequent messages.
