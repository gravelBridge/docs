Same automatically keeps track of your project's history, creating checkpoints at various stages. This allows you to easily review past states, preview them, and revert if needed.

## Automatic Checkpoints

Same creates a checkpoint automatically:

1.  **After every significant agent action:** Whenever Same makes changes like editing files, creating files, deleting files, or running certain commands, Same creates a checkpoint of the project state that is associated with that action's message block.

2.  **For every user message:** A checkpoint is also saved representing the state of the project _before_ your message was sent.

This ensures you have a granular history of both your instructions and Same's responses and actions.

## Accessing Version History

You can view the major versions (created after Same explicitly creates a `Version`) through the **Version History** panel:

1.  Click the **Clock icon** located in the top-right corner of the chat panel.
2.  A dropdown will appear showing a timeline of major versions and the latest state.

## Restoring and Reverting Checkpoints

Every user message and most agent action blocks (like file edits) have controls to interact with their associated checkpoints.

1.  **Restore Checkpoint:** Clicking this button next to a message or action block loads a **preview** of the project as it was _at that point in time_. The editor, preview, and terminal will update to reflect that state. A green "Current Checkpoint" badge will appear next to the message/action you restored.

      />
    </Frame>

2.  **Revert to Checkpoint:** After restoring a checkpoint, the button changes. Clicking "Revert to checkpoint" **permanently** reverts the project state back to that checkpoint. All subsequent messages and changes in the chat history will be cleared. Use this with caution!

3.  **User Message Checkpoints:** Restoring or reverting to a user message checkpoint will load the project state as it was _just before_ that user message was sent.

## Exiting Preview / Going to Latest

If you've restored a checkpoint (previewing an older state) and want to return to the most recent version of your project without permanently reverting:

1.  Click the **Clock icon** again.
2.  Click on **"Latest changes"** at the top of the history timeline.

This will reload the latest state of your project in the workbench without altering the chat history.
