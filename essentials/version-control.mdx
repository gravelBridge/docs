Same automatically saves checkpoints of your project as you work.

## Checkpoints

Checkpoints are created automatically:

1.  **After agent actions:** When Same edits, creates, or deletes files. The checkpoint is linked to the agent's message block.
2.  **For user messages:** Capturing the project state _before_ your instruction was processed.

This creates a detailed history of your prompts and Same's actions.

## Viewing History

Major versions (created when Same explicitly versions the project) are shown in the **Version History** panel.

1.  Click the **Clock icon** in the top-right of the chat panel.
2.  A dropdown shows major versions and the latest state.

## Restoring and Reverting

You can interact with checkpoints associated with user messages and agent actions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Preview a Checkpoint">
    Click **Restore checkpoint** next to a message or action block. This loads a **preview** of the project state at that point in the workbench (editor, preview, terminal). A green "Current Checkpoint" badge appears next to the restored item.

        alt="Screenshot showing the 'Restore checkpoint' button next to a message."
      />
    </Frame>
    <Frame caption="The green badge indicates the currently previewed checkpoint.">
      <img
        src="/images/current-checkpoint.png"
        alt="Screenshot showing the green 'Current Checkpoint' badge."
      />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Revert to a Checkpoint">
    After restoring (previewing) a checkpoint, the button changes to **Revert to checkpoint**. Clicking this **permanently** resets the project to that state. All later messages and changes are **deleted**. Use with caution.

    <Note>
      Restoring/reverting a user message loads the state *before* that message
      was processed.
    </Note>

        alt="Screenshot showing the 'Revert to checkpoint' button on a user message block."
      />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Return to Latest State (Exit Preview)">
    If you are previewing an older checkpoint and want to return to the current state *without* reverting:
    1. Click the **Clock icon**.
    2. Select **"Latest changes"** at the top.
    The workbench will reload the most recent project state.

    <Frame caption="Click 'Latest changes' to exit preview mode and view the current state.">

        src="/images/latest-changes.png"
        alt="Screenshot highlighting the 'Latest changes' option in the version history dropdown."
      />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
