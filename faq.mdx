  <Accordion title="How do I switch my Same project between public and private?">
    You can change project visibility in the **Workbench**. Open the Workbench (top-right arrows) and click the lock icon to toggle between **Public** (viewable/forkable by anyone) and **Private** (accessible only to you).

  <Accordion title="What is the refund policy if Same wastes tokens?">
    If you believe Same malfunctioned and caused excessive token usage unrelated to your prompts (e.g., due to a bug causing loops or repeated failures), please contact support at [support@same.dev](mailto:support@same.dev). Include your Project URL, a description of the issue, and any relevant Request IDs. We review cases individually and may issue credits or refunds if a platform malfunction is confirmed.
